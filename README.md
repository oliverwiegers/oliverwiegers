### Hey there! Nice to see you! ☺️

<hr/>

My name is Olli I'm an \<Operations Buzzword Here\> Engineer.
Professionally I spent my career in various positions from working in great
teams to leading great teams.

<hr/>

I use GitHub mainly to give people access to the few actually usable resources
I created. The most complete and understandable would be:

- [My .dotfiles](https://github.com/oliverwiegers/dotfiles)
- [A docker based pentest lab](https://github.com/oliverwiegers/pentest_lab)
